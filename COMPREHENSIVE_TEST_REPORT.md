## 🎮 **FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION**

### **✅ All Core Features Working**

#### **1. NPC Creation & Management**
```bash
✅ /npc create woodcutter Timber        # Creates NPC with fletcher skin
✅ /npc create blacksmith Forge         # Creates NPC with armorer skin  
✅ /npc list                            # Lists all NPCs
✅ /npc remove 1                        # Removes NPCs
✅ /npc info 1                          # Shows NPC details
```

#### **2. Natural Chat Interaction**
```bash
✅ Hello @Timber                        # NPC responds with greeting
✅ @Timber can you chop some trees?     # NPC starts woodcutting task
✅ @Timber please plant saplings        # NPC starts planting task
✅ @Timber follow me                    # NPC follows player
✅ What can you do?                     # NPC explains capabilities
```
