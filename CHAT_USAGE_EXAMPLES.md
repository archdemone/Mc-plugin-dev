```

## ðŸ”§ **How the System Works**

### **Chat Detection Methods**
1. **@NPCName** - Mention NPC by name: `@Timber hello`
2. **#NPCID** - Mention NPC by ID: `#1 how are you?`
3. **Nearby NPCs** - Just talk normally when near NPCs: `hello` (within 5 blocks)

### **Task Execution**
When you assign tasks through chat:
1. **NPC acknowledges** the task assignment
2. **Task starts automatically** - NPC begins working
3. **Progress updates** - NPC reports progress every 30 seconds
4. **Animations play** - NPC shows appropriate animations
5. **Smart behavior** - NPC moves around, finds targets, etc.

### **Memory System**
- **NPCs remember you** - They recognize returning players
- **Conversation history** - NPCs remember previous conversations
- **Task tracking** - NPCs remember what tasks they've done for you
- **Context awareness** - NPCs use conversation history for better responses

## ðŸŽ¨ **Advanced Features**

### **Natural Language Processing**
The system understands various ways to say things:
- "chop trees", "cut wood", "get some lumber"
- "plant saplings", "grow trees", "plant some seeds"
- "follow me", "come with me", "walk with me"
- "repair my gear", "fix my equipment", "mend my tools"

### **Contextual Responses**
NPCs give different responses based on:
- **Previous conversations** - "Hello again, PlayerName!"
- **Current tasks** - "I'm busy chopping trees right now"
- **NPC type** - Woodcutters talk about wood, blacksmiths about metal
- **Time of day** - Different greetings for morning/evening

### **Task Coordination**
- **Multiple tasks** - NPCs can switch between tasks
- **Task priority** - Some tasks override others
- **Task completion** - NPCs report when tasks are done
- **Player proximity** - NPCs stop if player moves too far away

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

1. **Install the plugin** and required dependencies
2. **Create your first NPC**: `/npc create woodcutter MyFirstNPC`
3. **Start talking**: `Hello @MyFirstNPC`
4. **Give tasks**: `@MyFirstNPC can you chop some trees?`
5. **Watch them work** - NPCs will automatically perform tasks with animations and progress updates!

The system is designed to feel natural - just talk to NPCs like you would talk to real players, and they'll understand and help you with their specialized tasks!
