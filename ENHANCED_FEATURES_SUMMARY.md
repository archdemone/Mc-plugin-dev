# NPC Integration Plugin - Enhanced Features Summary

## Overview
I have successfully enhanced the NPC Integration Plugin with all the requested features and additional improvements. The plugin now includes a comprehensive task management system, robust chat detection, tool requirements, sound/particle effects, and much more.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Multiple Task System
- **Task Queue Management**: NPCs can now queue multiple tasks and work through them systematically
- **Task Priority**: Tasks are processed in the order they were assigned
- **Queue Status**: Players can check NPC task queues and current progress
- **Maximum Queue Size**: Configurable limit (default: 10 tasks per NPC)

### 2. Task Configuration System
- **Customizable Task Parameters**:
  - Duration (how long tasks run)
  - Repetitions (how many times to repeat)
  - Delay between repetitions
  - Minimum/maximum collection amounts
  - Collection radius for finding resources
- **Pre-configured Task Types**:
  - Woodcutting: Optimized for tree chopping and log collection
  - Mining: Configured for ore mining and block breaking
  - Farming: Set up for crop harvesting and planting
  - Planting: Focused on sapling placement and tree growth
  - Following: Dynamic following behavior
  - Repairing: Equipment repair tasks
  - Smithing: Item crafting and metalwork

### 3. Sound Effects and Particle Systems
- **Work Sounds**: Different sounds for different task types
  - Woodcutting: Wood hit sounds, axe swing sounds
  - Mining: Stone hit sounds, pickaxe sounds
  - Farming: Crop break sounds, villager work sounds
  - Completion sounds: Level up sounds, villager happy sounds
- **Particle Effects**:
  - Work particles: Block crack particles, sweep attack particles
  - Completion particles: Villager happy particles, celebration effects
  - Configurable intervals for both sounds and particles

### 4. Task Switching and Interruption
- **Task Interruption**: NPCs can switch from current task to new urgent tasks
- **Interruptible vs Non-Interruptible**: Some tasks can be marked as critical and cannot be interrupted
- **Smart Task Management**: System automatically handles task transitions and cleanup
- **Progress Preservation**: Task progress is maintained when switching

### 5. Tool Requirements System
- **Tool Detection**: NPCs automatically detect what tools they need for specific tasks
- **Tool Requests**: NPCs ask players for required tools when they don't have them
- **Tool Inventory**: Each NPC has its own tool inventory that persists between sessions
- **Tool Giving**: Players can give tools to NPCs via chat or commands

### 6. Material Efficiency System
- **Tool Material Hierarchy**: Different tool materials provide different efficiency multipliers
  - Netherite: 2.5x efficiency
  - Diamond: 2.0x efficiency
  - Gold: 1.8x efficiency
  - Iron: 1.5x efficiency
  - Stone: 1.2x efficiency
  - Wood: 1.0x efficiency (baseline)
- **Dynamic Performance**: Better tools make NPCs work faster and more effectively
- **Automatic Tool Selection**: NPCs prefer better tools when available

### 7. Robust Chat Detection System
- **Keyword-Based Recognition**: Advanced keyword matching for natural language processing
- **Multiple Task Keywords**: Each task type recognizes dozens of related keywords
  - Woodcutting: "wood", "chop", "cut", "tree", "log", "lumber", "timber", "axe", etc.
  - Mining: "mine", "ore", "pickaxe", "stone", "rock", "cave", "underground", etc.
  - Farming: "farm", "crop", "plant", "harvest", "seed", "wheat", "carrot", etc.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: NPCs understand intent even with varied phrasing
- **Natural Language Examples**:
  - "Can you be a wood cutter?" âœ…
  - "I need logs" âœ…
  - "Can you chop wood for me?" âœ…
  - "Please help me with mining" âœ…
  - "I need you to farm some crops" âœ…
